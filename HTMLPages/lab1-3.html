            <strong>Article 1:</strong>This section will have two articles grouped together. This section containers are used to group other elements together, usually for positioning porposes so we will use them more in the later lessons. Elements mat also be grouped together ina section to so that the area of the page grouped by the section can be formatted with the same style, or background color such as this example. 
        </article>
        <article>
            <strong>Article 2:</strong>The articles do not necessarily have to go inside the section, however if the articles are to be formatted into a single container, for example they need to be position or sized togther, you can achieve this by placing both in a single section and formatting the section. The articles will inherit the formatting applied to the section.
