         <p>A web designer is an individual that makes their living by designing and maintaining web sites. This is a field that has evovled extremely quickly over the past decade, but the fundamentals still remain the same. Any web designer must have a strong understanding of the HTML language. Contrary to what most people believe HTML is not a programming language, but a formatting language developed by<strong>Tim Burners-Lee</strong>in 1989. Since its original development HTML has come a long way and has incorporated a multitide of new features. HTML allowed the development of the World Wide Web and the explsive popularity of the Internet!
        
        
         <p>As HTML evovled, developers soon realized that the structure of web pages should be defiend using HTML, and the pages style, look, and feel,. should be deined separately, thus the brith of cascading style sheets. Now developers use HTML to define what the information on the web page is, such as a heading content, article content, a paragraph within the article or footer content, etc. Cascading sheets were desined to defined the colors of document,the size, margins, colors, and positioning of the various elements of the web page.
        
        
        <p> About the time the HTML and the World Wide Web were hitting the public sector, PHP was being developed to make web pages a more powerful tool. PHP is a scripting language that is written direcly on the wepage and interpreted by the web server which would send the final version of the web page to the visitor's browser. About a year later, Netscape released the first version of JavaScript, under the name Mocha which later became LiveScript, and then JavaScript. JavaScript is also a sripting language, but unlike PHP, JavaScript is interpreted by the visitor browser rather than the web server. As a result JavaScript is not a powefull as PHP and lacks the ability to interact with a database, but still provides processing functionality to a web page. Web designers now days must not only be proficient in HTML and CSS, but a veriety of scripting language as well. Even though HTMl was the first language of the web, many more have come along, nut still remainf the fundamental structure that the web page is built from.
