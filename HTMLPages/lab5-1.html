             <h2>Sunflowers</h2>
             Vam Gogh's paintings of sunflowers are among his most famous. He did them in Arles, in the south of France, in 1888 and 1889. Vincent painted a total of five large canvases with sunflowers in a vase, with three shades of yellow `and nothing else`. In this way, he demonstrated that is was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single color, without any loss of eloquence.
